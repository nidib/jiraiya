# Jiraiya - Jira with super metric powers

## Usage guide
This application exposes the following services:

| Service | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| backend/core | The main backend api, where all the data from jira is fetched and processed | Alpha testing |
| frontend/dashboard | A dashboard that consumes the api above, and provides options to fetch data from jira | Alpha testing |

### First steps
- Clone this repo
- Make a copy of .env_sample renaming it to .env
- Set your environment variables
- Run the app with the command `./scripts/start.sh up`

### How to fetch and store data?
- For the example below a board of id 17 will have its data fetched (Currently only one board can be stored)
  - Hit a GET request at `http://localhost:{BACKEND_CORE_PORT}/update?board=17`

### Where is the data stored?
- This application also creates a Postgres database and all your data is stored there
- All of its tables will be in a database called jiraiya inside a schema also called jiraiya
- So, for example - to see all your board issues - you can do as follow:
```sql
SELECT * FROM jiraiya.issue;
```


## Development guide
- Currently the only way to develop this application is by rebuilding its image every time there is a change on the source code. This can be done by running at the project root:
  - `$ ./scripts/start.sh up`
